    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <p><li>Melt butter and oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. 
            Add mushrooms, season with salt, and saute, stirring occasionally, until they turn golden brown, 
            5 to 10 minutes. Add onion and ground beef. Cook, stirring, until meat is browned and crumbly, and onions turn soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. 
            Season with black pepper and cayenne.</li> </p>

        <p><li>Stir in minced garlic and flour, and cook for 1 minute. Pour in vodka and allow to evaporate, about 30 seconds. Stir in beef broth and water and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes.</li></p>
        <p><li>Reduce heat to medium, and mix in noodles. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and simmer for 5 minutes. Uncover and stir thoroughly. Cover again and cook until noodles are just tender, about 3 minutes.</li></p>
        <p><li>Once noodles are cooked, reduce heat to low, and stir in sour cream. Serve immediately with additional sour cream and green onions or chives if so desired.</li></p>
